        description: 'My objective with this project was to take an existing website and duplicate it without looking at the codebase. Originally built with only HTML, CSS, and JS, I then refactored to incorporate EJS templating and built a backend with Express and Mongo. I improved on the design (IMO) by adding smooth-scrolling dropdown menus and custom forms. ',

        description: "Color Crusher was my final project for App Academy and my objective was to build something that nobody had seen before. Users can convert color values from RGB to HSL or HEX and vice-versa. I then wrote algorithms to create a random RGB color value, convert it to HSL and then find its complement, split-complement and analogous friends. The balls are assigned these colors and a loop can be run.... creating a never ending display of random colors that match. I also wrote a custom hook that will delay the rendering of each ball which creates an interesting effect. In addition to the color conversions I also made a game where you can guess the RGB color values, score points and possibly join the leader board. The GitHub Read-Me is also worth a look as I used SVG to create something original. Kudos to my instructors at App Academy for giving me the freedom to create something as strange as Color Crusher.",
